  title: About Me
  description: |
    As a front-end developer with several years of experience, I leverage my expertise in Vue.js (Nuxt), React (Next.js), and modern web ecosystems to design and develop high-performing, scalable digital solutions.
    My approach combines technical rigor with a strong focus on user experience, transforming complex concepts into intuitive, fluid interfaces. I have contributed to the development of solutions like WI-AGRI and E-AGRI, working on frontend architecture, integrating business modules, ensuring client-side security, and managing asynchronous data.
    Passionate about innovation, I stay constantly updated to incorporate best practices in web development and deliver products that are reliable, modern, and user-centered.
